Here is a step-by-step implementation of big data batch processing using ADF to schedule and orchestrate Spark jobs with Python code:

Set up Azure Data Factory (ADF):
Create an Azure Data Factory instance in the Azure portal.
Create an input data source (e.g., Azure Data Lake Storage) and an output data sink (e.g., Azure Synapse Analytics).
Ingest data into the data lake:
Use ADF's data movement activities (e.g., Copy activity) to ingest data from various sources into the data lake.
The data can be stored in the data lake in a format such as Parquet or Avro.
Create Spark Job:
Create a Spark job using PySpark in a Jupyter notebook.
The Spark job will process and analyze the data stored in the data lake.
Schedule Spark job in ADF:
Create a pipeline in ADF that contains a Spark job activity.
Configure the Spark job activity to reference the Spark job created in step 3.
Schedule the pipeline to run at a specific time (e.g., daily or weekly).
Monitor the pipeline:
Monitor the pipeline run status in ADF to track the progress of the Spark job.
If the Spark job encounters any errors, troubleshoot and resolve the issue.
Store the results:
Store the results of the Spark job in the output data sink.
The results can be stored in a format such as Parquet or Avro.
