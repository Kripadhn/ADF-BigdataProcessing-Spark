#H ere is an example of a PySpark code that reads data from a data lake and performs a simple count operation: 
# These are just a few examples of how ADF and Spark can be used for big data processing. The combination 
# of ADF and Spark offers a flexible and scalable solution for processing large volumes of data in a variety of use cases.
