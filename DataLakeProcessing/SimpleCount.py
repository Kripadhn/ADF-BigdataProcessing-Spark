from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DataLakeProcessing").getOrCreate()

# Read data from data lake
df = spark.read.parquet("adl://<your-adls-account-name>.azuredatalakestore.net/<your-folder>/<your-file>.parquet")

# Perform count operation
count = df.count()

# Print the result
print("Count:", count)

# Stop Spark session
spark.stop()

# This is a basic example of how ADF and Spark can be used to process and analyze big data stored in a data lake. 
# The code can be further extended to perform more complex operations such as data transformation, aggregation, and machine learning.
