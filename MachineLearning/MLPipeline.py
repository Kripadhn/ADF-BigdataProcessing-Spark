# Here is an example of PySpark code that trains a logistic regression model:
# This is a basic example of how ADF and Apache Spark can be used to create an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. 
# The code can be further extended to perform more complex operations such as feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
